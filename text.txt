One of Python’s most powerful features is its 
ability to manipulate text and files. In the DevOps 
world, you are continually parsing, searching, and 
changing the text in files, whether you’re searching 
application logs or propagating configuration files. 
Files are a means of persisting the state of your data, 
code, and configuration; they are how you look back at 
what happened in logs and how you control what happens with 
configuration. With Python, you can create, read, and change
files and text in the code that you can use repeatedly. 
Automating these tasks is indeed one aspect of modern DevOps 
that separates it from traditional system administration. 
Rather than keeping a set of instructions that you have to
follow manually, you can write code. This diminishes your 
chances of missing steps or doing them out of order. If you are 
confident that your system uses the same steps every time you 
run it, you can have greater understanding and confidence in the 
process.
